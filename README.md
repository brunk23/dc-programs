# dc-programs
Programs written for the dc(1) *nix program 

dc is one of my favorite utilities on linux and unix systems. I almost
always have a terminal window open with an instance of dc running, for
quick calculations. Of course, this leads to times when I want to do
a calculation over and over and that leads to the creation of simple
programs for certain tasks.

There have been other times when I intentionally used dc for a programming
challenge. It can be pretty challenging as it was not intended to be used
for that task. It only has single character register names. Those are
only allowed to hold a value or a stack of values.

Most of the time, you can avoid using registers entirely by using the
general purpose stack.
