This program will print the prime factors of a given number.  This is
not my original creation. 

http://www.cs.unh.edu/~charpov/Programming/DC/ is the location I originally
saw this bit of obsfucated dc.  It was neat, though, and prime factorization
is a common task at my grade level, so I kept it.

I did end up rewriting it without all the, intentionally confusing, register
name choices and with comments.  It was put into a shell script. I have
included that version as factor-commented
