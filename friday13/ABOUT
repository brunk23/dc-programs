I decided to use dc to make a program that will tell you all the possible
Friday the 13ths between two given dates.  This is the obsfucated version.

I have included a commented version of the code, that explains how it works.
Unfortunately, even commented, the code is still not easy to read.

I am still pretty pround of this program. It's not only a complete mess to
read and try to understand, but the functionality is really cool to
implement in this language.
